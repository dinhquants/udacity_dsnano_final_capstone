## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I got interested in cancer research so  to better understand:

1. Which features are most helpful in predicting malignant or benign cancer? Which features are not helpful in predicting malignant or benign cancer?
2. How do different models predict cancer diagnosis?
3. What is the best models predict?

The full set of files related to this course are owned by Udacity, so they are not publicly available here.  However, you can see pieces of the analysis here.  This README also serves as a template for students to follow in creating their own project README files.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  The notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main result of analysis dataset can be found at the blog post available [here](https://medium.com/@dinhnda2021/wisconsin-breast-cancer-dataset-analysis-2db2a51bde9d).
